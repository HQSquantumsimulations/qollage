# qollage

Typesetting tool for the qoqo/roqoqo quantum toolkit by [HQS Quantum Simulations](https://quantumsimulations.de).

This repository contains two components:

* roqollage: the core rust library that builds on the roqoqo rust library.  
* qollage: the python interface to roqollage that uses the qoqo python interface.

This repository uses the [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) typesetting system with the [quill](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/tree/main) package to create quantum circuits.

Drawing tool for the qoqo quantum toolkit by [HQS Quantum Simulations](https://quantumsimulations.de).

Qollage provides the save_circuit and draw_circuit functions that allows users to translate a qoqo circuit into a png image and either save it or display it.  
It also provides the circuit_to_typst_str that can be used to generate a string that can be copy pasted in the Typst interpreter if you want to edit the circuit further.
The latest qoqo gates might not be implemented in qollage yet.
A circuit containing not supported operations can't be drawn.  
If a gate has a string parameter it will be printed inside a typst mathematical expression and the typst symbols will be replaced.  
Alphanumerical expressions will be preprocessed, if it doesn't represent any typst symbol it will be escaped by surrounding quotes.  
`qoqo.operations.RotateX(0, "theta")` will be formatted as `Î¸`.  
`qoqo.operations.RotateX(0, "param")` will be escaped with quotes and kept as it is.  
`qoqo.operations.RotateX(0, "\"param\"")` will not be accepted because the extra quotes will interfere with the quotes added to escape `param`.  
For more informations see [the documentation](https://typst.app/docs/reference/math/).  
Here is the [list of symbols](https://typst.app/docs/reference/symbols/sym/) but be aware that not all of them are supported by [the font used](https://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/fonts/firamath/firamath-specimen.pdf).

### Example:

In a jupyter cell:
```python
from qoqo import Circuit, operations as ops
from qollage import draw_circuit

circuit = Circuit()
circuit += ops.DefinitionBit("ro", 2, True)
circuit += ops.Hadamard(0)
circuit += ops.CNOT(0, 1)
circuit += ops.PauliX(1)
circuit += ops.RotateX(0, "theta")
circuit += ops.MeasureQubit(0, "ro", 0)
circuit += ops.MeasureQubit(1, "ro", 1)

draw_circuit(circuit)
```
It will output:

Typesetting tool for the roqoqo quantum toolkit by [HQS Quantum Simulations](https://quantumsimulations.de).

roqollage provides the circuit_to_image function that allows users translate a roqoqo circuit into a DynamicImage of the circuit's representation.  
Not all roqoqo operations have a corresponding Typst expression.  
Circuits containing operations without a corresponding expression can not be translated.

## General Notes

This software is still in the beta stage. Functions and documentation are not yet complete, can contain bugs and breaking changes can occur.

## Known issue

If there are many gates that are represented by a slice the slice label might overlap or there might be some gaps between the slices.  
If there is a gate represented by a slice inside a circuit used in a gate (i.e. PragmaLoop) the slice will got through all the qubits not only the ones used by the gate' circuit. Issues mentionned in the first line also applies here.
